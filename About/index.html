            So, my name is Amanda and I'm a fictional character of an unfinished Sci-fi novel, written by the
            wannabe author who actually made this website. You can call him Glenn, or Green, or Yann or whatever, 
            I don't really care, although he probably does, so...
          </p>
          <p>
            He's French, about 20, currently a student, is into computer stuff as much as I am, and he's one of those people who are pretentious enough to call themselves 
            "an artist" because he has a cheap notepad and a <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/greenjacketboy" target="_blank">Deviant art account</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            So why is he making <b>me</b> a portfolio website ? Short answer : He's out of stuff to work on for 
            <a href="https://greenjacketboy.github.io/">his own</a>.
          </p>
