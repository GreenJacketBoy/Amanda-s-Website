            <span> I'm a bit surprised that you've landed here, among all the other (very good) ones.</span>

              Well as a disclaimer, <a href="About/index.html">I don't actually exist</a>, but other than that : My Human name is
              Amanda, I belong to the Metody specie, I'm around 26 years old, and disregarding the lack of other textfields for you
              to refer to me in any waaaaaaay... You can consider my gender to be female.

              Also, also, I'm currently <i>serving</i> (I'm not exactly in love with this term, but everyone seems to use it, so) on
              a Human ship of Continental class named the Antarctica. It's a big (<b>big</b>) repair ship, where I do all sort of 
              computer and software related stuff, mostly on the ships we pick up, but sometimes on the Antarctica itself.
