              Oooh, yeah ! No, yes, he told about you guys.
            </span>
            <span>
              I was like : "Why are you not using the form on the hiring website ?"
            </span>
            <span>
              And he spoke about "what they want, not what's expected" and some vague social engineering language,
              and then I don't remember what he said until the part where I'm supposed to advertise him.
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              But listen, he's doing the wrong, but I want him to learn from his mistakes.
            </span>
            <span>
              Look he's probably in class right now, but just in case, here's his <a href="https://proseconsult.umontpellier.fr/direct/?data=cccedc8e0252194ae3275044b07e02af4f51f7d91eb3648604d628113e82760dbed8d89011b8db3f565a6eba3fb421d313f6c63370d69630c73e5d47e7b4caa205b671755e2e313accf1c0ae7bea9fe2ffaaa69cbd14fea5a6d0111bfaa17a823cc1c3b4302fc5dd2762be0aa3a53986aa46015363b2752612a410752d15eaafd211eeb7936734e0cd7fd38213cedc0eec845302a004ead06829e11b88069c0470ffb5ed45df960ede2292b82b30eb71f5f63c64469f19d3ae90f017019dad1d,1">planning</a>
              for the week, make sure to call him during an important class, alright ? 
            </span>
            <span>
              Don't worry, you're doing him a favor in the long run.

              Sorry what ?
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              What do you mean "we might be interested" ?
            </span>
            <span>
              No I'm telling you this guy is a walking red flag, he... Okay, fine.
            </span>

          <p>
            <span>
              You're Coderpad right ? Yeah that's in the url. Good, good.
            </span>
            <span>
              I see he was "interested" in your internship, hummm, nanana, something about a certain "React",
              some more buzzwords...
            </span>
            <span>
              Says he reasonates with your philosophy of testing real skills, yeah sure, L-O-L, try saying your grades
              suck without saying it.

              Still interested ?
            </span>
            <span>
              Really ?
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              Alright, here's his website, just go over to his portoflio to find stuff that's written in french.
              I asked him "why not send the link to the french portfolio directly", he said he spent too much time on
              the CSS for it to get ignored. Anyways.
